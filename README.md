## Challenges:

Stripe integration! With all of the documentation, guides, tutorials online on how to use Stripe, it became information overload. Suddenly I found myself lost and confused in all of the ways to add Stripe to my page. I had to take a step back - skim all of the information that was available and then decide what components were applicable to my project. Once I was able to focus, I was able to succesfully integrate Stripe.
